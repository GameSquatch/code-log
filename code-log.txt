Here is where I will log my codes for the day. Not sure why I
am doing this, but I probably should just to keep practicing git.

I finished a Udacity course on git where I learned a bunch of stuff
that will help me use version control and possibly contribute to an
open-source project in the future.

I started applying git to some of my projects that I had already
started to see how it would start benefiting me. I did it to
TextGame and CardDraw, but I haven't really had a nice, relaxing
time to sit down and make changes to either of those documents.
I also think this will be really nice for web codes too.

I did some coding in the car on our hunting road trip. I made
some changes to TextGame, because I want to finally finish that
game already. I've made so many non-working versions. I just want
one to play with.
